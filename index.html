                <p>Doctors play a pivotal role in building the society. They are the lifelines of the community. This
                    term can be used very literally for the Doctors who shape culture and save those that are diseased
                    and unhealthy. Doctors work hard to save the lives of patients with serious ailments. They act as an
                    inspiration to society.

                    The job of a Doctor is to find out what the disease of a person us to provide medicines and
                    treatments accordingly. There are various kinds of doctors. Some specialize in heart medication,
                    while some specialize in childrenâ€™s diseases. The task of the Doctor is hence varied and highly
                    convoluted.
